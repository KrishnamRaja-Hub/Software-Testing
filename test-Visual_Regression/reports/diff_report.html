See image and explanation below:</p><img src="../diffs/chrome_diff.png" alt="Diff for chrome" style="max-width:100%;"><br><br><h4>ðŸ§  Gemini's Explanation:</h4><p>The visual diff shows the following changes:

1. **Cyan border around the entire webpage:** This suggests changes to the webpage's overall padding, border, or possibly even a slight shift in the overall layout.

2. **Red/Orange text changes:** The text "Login Page,"  the introductory text under the title, the placeholder text in the username and password fields, and the text "Login" on the button all show red/orange discoloration, indicating changes in these text elements.  This likely means the text itself has been altered (e.g., font, case, or spacing).  The same color on the "Login" button may also indicate changes to its background color or style.

3. **Magenta/Pink area in the upper right corner:** This indicates the addition of a new element or graphic, potentially a banner, link, or other UI element in this upper-right corner. The angle suggests it might be a banner with text.


4. **Cyan line at the very bottom:**  This indicates a change affecting the bottom border or spacing of the page.  It may imply a change in padding or the presence/absence of a horizontal rule.

5. **Slight color variation in the "Powered by Elemental Selenium" text:** This suggests changes to the font, color, or spacing of this footer text.</p><h2>Firefox</h2><p>âœ… No differences found.</p></body></html>
